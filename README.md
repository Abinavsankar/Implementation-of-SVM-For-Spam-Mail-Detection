# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
Step 1:Start.
Step 2:Import the required libraries.
Step 3:Read the data frame using pandas.
Step 4:Get the information regarding the null values present in the dataframe. 
Step 5:Split the data into training and testing sets.
Step 6:Convert the text data into a numerical representation using CountVectorizer. 
Step 7:Use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train a model on the training data and make predictions on the testing data.
Step 8:Finally, evaluate the accuracy of the model.
Step 9:Stop.
